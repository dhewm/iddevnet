The sound editor can be opened by typing "editSounds" in the console.  It
will probably take a while to load, because it is scanning and loading a
bunch of sounds, be patient.  The sound editor was designed for a sound guy
(non-level designer) to run around the levels and create a spooky aureal
experience, so it works independant of radiant.

</p><p>
When the sound editor is up, you can switch to the game easily by clicking
"Switch to Game" but when the game is up, you can't exactly mouse over
to the sound editor.  There are a few ways of switching back, but the easiest
is to bind a key to "editSounds" (type "bind &lt;key&gt; editSounds" in
the console).

</p><p>

At first glance, the sound editor is kind of daunting, but it's really
not all that complex when you get down to it.  The bare minimum you need
to do to make a sound play in the world is click the 'Drop Speaker...' button
(near the bottom).  This will place a speaker in front of you.  Next browse
the tree in the middle and double click on a sound (I'm fond of loop_fan_1
in the sound/fans.sndshd file).  Technically that's all you need to get
a sound emitter in the game, but there are obviously other things you can do.

</p><p>
To move sounds around in the world, use the y+ y- x+ x- z+ z- buttons in
the top-right of the window.  It may seem like a clunky interface, but it
actually starts to feel right after using it for a bit (you can just click
on a sound, move it left a few units and go on your way).

</p><p>
A lot of the options present in the window can also be changed in the sound
shader.  If the value is set to 0 in the editor, then it uses the value in
the sound shader.  This means if a sound shader has shakes, then setting "shakes"
to 0 in the editor will not disable the shakes.  This also means if a flag
is turned on in the sound shader, it cannot be turned off in the editor.  Keep
this in mind if a sound is looping even though "Looping" is not checked.

</p><p>
Here's a brief description of all the check boxes you can check:
</p><table class="datatable">
<tbody><tr><td>Occlusion</td><td>Don't flow through portals, only use straight line</td>
</tr><tr><td>Omnidirectional</td><td>Fall off with distance, but play same volume in all speakers</td>
</tr><tr><td>Looping</td><td>Repeat the sound continuously</td>
</tr><tr><td>Plain</td><td>- Unused -</td>
</tr><tr><td>Triggered</td><td>Don't start playing until the entity is triggered</td>
</tr><tr><td>Unclamped</td><td>Don't clamp calculated volumes at 1.0</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

<p>
The "Trigger" button will trigger the selected entity.  Useful for testing the
sound on an entity that needs to be triggered first.

</p><p>
The group name, and groups selection box lets you group multiple sounds together
for ease in searching and selection (in theory)  I don't think anyone actually
ended up using that feature though, which makes me think it doesn't work right.
